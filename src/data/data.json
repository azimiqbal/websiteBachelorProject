    "About": {
        "paragraph": "Our project is to develop a testing system for any vehicle the Norwegian army want to measure. We must design a physical platform that is able to measure the weight, angle and center of gravity for vehicles with wheels or belts, that weigh anywhere from 5 to 75 tons. Along with designing the platform, an important requirement given to us from our customer is that a complete test for any given vehicle should be completed within 4 hours, and after completion, a report with the desired information should be generated and stored. This is a multidisciplinary project, where we must combine hardware and software in order to develop a complete system.",
        "Why2": [
            "With current methods, many many soldiers are used in the process of testing",
            "Current methods are time consuming and expensive"
        ],
        "Why": [
            "The ability to measure accurate weight, angle and center of gravity is required in order to operate a vehicle",
            "A more modern, digital system is desired"

The presentation included an introduction of who we are, the problem domain and how we will work as a group moving forward. We also gave a slight insight into the technical aspects of the project, but that will be more of the focus for the next presentation. For more updates along the way, stay tuned :)",
